# Simple Validation API with Express and JWT
I'm working on this simple API for User/Email Verification for private routes, using Express as Backend Server, nodemon as database manager for MongoDB.
Joi as a third party validation (yes, I haven't writed my own validation)
And least but not last JWT for login credential.

#Update
Done, updated the JWT token creation and implementation. Gonna re-upload a next version to revoke token auth on click or on destroyed.
Possibly gonna use this api server on another proyect as a backend api.
