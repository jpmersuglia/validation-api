# Simple Validation API with Express and JWT
I'm working on this simple API for User/Email Verification for private routes, using Express as Backend Server, nodemon as database manager for MongoDB.
Joi as a third party validation (yes, I haven't writed my own validation)
And least but not last JWT for login credential.

#Update
Gonna upload the finished part when my Atlas isn't triking me over connection timeout for proper testing of the app. Or gonna use MongoDB Community Edition for testing purposes.
